I completed my PhD in computing science at the [[https://cs.ualberta.ca][University of Alberta]] in 2014,
where I applied optimization to heuristic search.  Today I do deep learning at
[[https://ibm.com][IBM]]'s Global Chief Data Office.  Before IBM, I was a data scientist at [[https://dissolve.com][Dissolve]]
working on the search engine.

This page is a portfolio of sorts -- find more on [[https://github.com/riscy][GitHub]] and [[https://linkedin.com/in/riscy/][LinkedIn]].

* Search Engine
  I was [[http://www.dissolve.com][Dissolve]]'s data scientist from April 2015 to September 2017.  My focus
  was on enhancing the search engine and the data behind it; I also did web dev
  and kept the data warehouse healthy.  My largest contributions centered on
  automation and process improvement -- key projects include:
  - Keyword quality enhancement :: I designed a tool to cluster keywords on the
       order of tens of millions across spelling, typographic, and corrupted
       unicode variants.  This enabled outlier detection, data exploration, and
       keyword normalization at an even greater scale than Google's OpenRefine.
  - Recovering same shoot data :: I built a machine learning workflow with a
       human in the loop that recovered lost "same shoot" data for hundreds of
       thousands of Dissolve's products.  This feature became a significant
       selling point for the site and has received accolades from customers and
       contributors alike.
       # (over 650,000 as of September 2017)
  - Domain-specific search vocabulary :: I played a key role in building
       Dissolve's industry-leading vocabulary which relates synonyms, hypernyms,
       and ambiguous terms in a graph.  This improved precision and recall,
       massively augmented Elasticsearch's /suggest/ endpoint, and enforced
       important consistency checks.
  - Spam detection :: Spam is everywhere.  Dissolve is no different, as
                      contributors can be tempted to misapply keywords to get
                      their products to appear in more searches.  I led the
                      effort to create a dataset and subsequently built a model
                      wrapped in a microservice to help detect this spam.
* Optimizing Heuristics
  Heuristic search is the backbone of applications like GPS road navigation and
  video game pathfinding.  Here, the "heuristic" is a scalar function that maps
  pairs of states to an estimate of the true distance between them.  A good
  heuristic helps the algorithm to rank candidate paths, which decreases cycle
  times and can lead to higher-quality solutions.

  I posed the task of building better heuristics as a machine learning problem:
  minimizing loss between the true distances and the heuristic's estimates.  I
  derived several instances where performing such an optimization is feasible
  and tractable (or at least approximable).  The solutions tend to have
  intuitive visuals that can be likened to unfolding the search space (pictured,
  courtesy Nathan Sturtevant).

  This work also revealed unobserved links between heuristic search and other
  computing subfields (numerical optimization, manifold learning,
  multidimensional scaling), provided a framework for analyzing past approaches,
  and boosted search performance in several domains.

* Data Mining Counter-Strike
  An "opening" is a fixed sequence of actions you choose to play out the start
  of a game with.  A familiar example of a game where openings are important is
  chess.  If you have a formal way to recognize an opening, it's easy to query a
  database of games for its success rate, popularity, etc.

  But what about a game like Counter-Strike?  Its fine-grained state space
  precludes identifying openings by way of a table lookup.  But it is still
  reasonable to assume that, with enough recorded gameplay data, you can model
  trends.  I started to do so by creating a visualization of the "next-state
  entropy" of expert players moving through a popular Counter-Strike map.  An
  initial choice is made (hot colors, bottom), invariably followed by fixed
  actions (cold colors), followed by another choice...

  #+attr_html: :width 50%
  [[file:img/entropy_visualization.png]]

  This high regularity meant that cluster analysis was effective in tightly
  grouping these openings.  The clusters formed the basis for the "opening book"
  I was after, and ultimately gave me categorical data within which I was able
  to find trends.  It also helped me build regressors for predicting player
  movement and classifiers to distinguish human and machine play.

  (This research was also featured in the Dec 2008 /IEEE Spectrum Magazine/
  article [[http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/bots-get-smart][Bots Get Smart]].)
* Emacs Packages
  I maintain a couple of Emacs packages on [[https://melpa.org][MELPA]] that improve Emacs's REPLs
  (especially ~shell-mode~ but also ~inferior-python-mode~ and really anything
  built on top of ~comint-mode~):
** shx mode
   [[https://github.com/riscy/shx-for-emacs][shx-mode]] ("shell-extras") supports a simple markup language for embedding
   graphics and plots within a session (similar to a Jupyter notebook), adds
   event-driven and timed behaviors, and makes it easy for users to write their
   own shell commands in Emacs Lisp.  It also adds a host of interface
   improvements including improved syntax highlighting.
** bifocal mode
  When you turn on [[https://github.com/riscy/bifocal-mode][bifocal-mode]], paging up causes a comint-mode window to be
  split in two.  The large window on top (the head) displays past output, while
  the small window on the bottom (the tail) allows the user to continue to
  interact with the current input and output.
* Other Projects
  Here are a few implementations and write-ups on some interesting algorithms:
  - [[https://github.com/riscy/machine_learning_linear_models][Machine Learning with Linear Models]] :: This is a small demo showcasing a few
       distinct linear models for mapping vectors of observations /X/ to vectors
       of outcomes /Y/. Different assumptions about the data can lead to
       different levels of performance – sometimes drastically.
  - [[https://github.com/riscy/a_star_on_grids][Best practices for A\star on grids]] :: I learned a bit about writing a good
       pathfinder in grad school.  Here's a list of ways to improve your A\star
       implementation, focusing on pathfinding on four- and eight-connected
       grids.  It's pitched at hobbyists and anyone looking for ways to make
       their existing code a bit faster, and has [[https://github.com/riscy/a_star_on_grids/tree/master/src][accompanying code in C++]].
  - [[https://github.com/riscy/sammon_mapping_gsl][Sammon mapping]] :: Given a Euclidean distance matrix, there is a /closed
                      form/ to find the corresponding points.  This computation
                      is a key step in many embedding algorithms. But when
                      you're given a distance matrix that is non-Euclidean, you
                      might have to do something else.  The Sammon Map was an
                      early attempt at this.  This is a C implementation using
                      BLAS (requires the GNU scientific library) that also
                      supports nonlinear dimensionality reduction.

  Beyond those listed above, I'm grateful to have been a part of a number of
  other projects spanning computer poker, subjective robotics, and real-time
  heuristic search.  Some resulted in publication:
