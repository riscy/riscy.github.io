I'm a [[https://riscy.io/#2020.08.11][computing scientist]] interested in software quality and all sorts of
problems in optimization and search.  I completed my PhD in 2014 at the
[[https://cs.ualberta.ca][University of Alberta]], where I machine-learned pathfinding heuristics.  Since
then I worked with a great team on advancing the search engine at [[https://dissolve.com][Dissolve]], and
today I lead a team in Applied AI/ML at the [[https://ibm.com][IBM]] Global Chief Data Office.

This is a portfolio of recent work.  You can also find me on [[https://github.com/riscy][GitHub]], [[https://linkedin.com/in/riscy/][LinkedIn]],

* IBM Chief Data Office
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: metadata_and_data_governance
  :END:
  I joined the [[https://ibm.com][IBM]] Global Chief Data Office as a senior data scientist in
  November 2017.  IBM is huge and over a century old which brings all kinds of
  challenges into play, but this also means there are open spaces where machine
  learning and other new processes can come in and have lasting effects:
  - International regulatory compliance :: When I joined IBM, the looming [[https://gdpr-info.eu/][GDPR]]
    gave impetus for tools to scan for personal data, and I led a team in
    developing one.  A key idea was to 'flip the script' and approach the design
    as if our client were a regulatory auditor as opposed to an internal
    employee.  At the tool's core was a deep neural network optimized against
    the structure of relational databases.
  - Static analysis of machine learning codebases :: I built an automated code
    review service specialized to Python machine learning projects (and their
    idiosyncrasies).  This provided plug & play static analysis to dozens of
    projects IBM-wide.  It became, by a wide margin, the most popular component
    of our internal MLOps effort.
  - Deploying machine learning models :: This is the most tenuous phase of any
    machine learning project -- and it has become my wheelhouse!  It includes
    reproducible builds, monitoring, and software quality (clarity, performance,
    tests).  But one must also understand/document upstream data, maintain
    pipelines, and uncover silent failures (information leakage, domain shift,
    bad assumptions).
  - Deep learning for data cataloging and search :: To maintain a searchable
    inventory of IBM's internal data, the CDO has to integrate inputs from many
    different business units.  This is overwhelming without automation.  I play
    a key role in developing and deploying the deep learning models that support
    this effort, the likes of which I helped commercialize and build into [[https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-knowledge-catalog][Watson
    Knowledge Catalog]], a flagship IBM product.
* Retrieve and Rank
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: retrieve_and_rank
  :END:
  I was [[http://www.dissolve.com][Dissolve]]'s data scientist from April 2015 to September 2017.  My main
  focus was enhancing the search engine and the metadata behind it; I also did
  web dev and kept the data warehouse healthy.  My largest contributions
  centered on automation and process improvement.  Key projects include:

  - Recovering same-shoot data :: I designed a machine learning workflow with a
       human in the loop that recovered lost /same shoot/ data for hundreds of
       thousands of Dissolve's products.  This feature received accolades from
       customers and contributors alike and is now a significant selling point
       for the site.
       # (over 650,000 as of September 2017)
  - Keyword quality enhancement :: I built a tool to cluster keywords on the
       order of tens of millions across spelling, typographic, and corrupted
       unicode variants.  This enabled outlier detection, data exploration, and
       keyword normalization at an even greater scale than Google's OpenRefine.
  - Domain-specific search vocabulary :: I played a key role in building
       Dissolve's industry-leading vocabulary which relates synonyms, hypernyms,
       and ambiguous terms in a graph.  This improved precision and recall,
       massively augmented Elasticsearch's /suggest/ endpoint, and enforced
       important consistency checks.
  - Spam detection :: Spam is everywhere.  Dissolve is no different, as
                      contributors can be tempted to misapply keywords to get
                      their products to appear in more searches.  I led the
                      effort to create a dataset, and subsequently built a model
                      wrapped in a microservice to help detect this spam.

* Optimization for Heuristic Search
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: optimization_heuristic_search
  :END:
  Heuristic search is the backbone of applications like GPS road navigation and
  video game pathfinding.  Here, the "heuristic" is a scalar function that maps
  pairs of states to an estimate of the true distance between them.  A good
  heuristic helps the algorithm to rank candidate paths, which decreases cycle
  times and can lead to higher-quality solutions.

  I posed the task of building better heuristics as a machine learning problem:
  minimizing loss between the true distances and the heuristic estimates.  I
  derived several instances where such an optimization is feasible and tractable
  (or at least approximable).  The solutions are /state embeddings/ with
  intuitive visuals that can be likened to unfolding the search space (pictured,
  courtesy Nathan Sturtevant).

  [[file:img/heuristic_optimization.png]]

  This work also revealed unobserved links between heuristic search and other
  computing subfields (numerical optimization, manifold learning,
  multidimensional scaling), provided a framework for analyzing past approaches,
  and boosted search performance in several domains.

* Data Mining Counter-Strike
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: data_mining_counter_strike
  :END:
  An "opening" is a fixed sequence of actions you choose to play out the start
  of a game with.  A familiar example of a game where openings are important is
  chess.  If you have a formal way to recognize an opening, it's easy to query a
  database of games for its success rate, popularity, etc.

  But what about a game like Counter-Strike?  Its fine-grained state space
  precludes identifying openings by way of a table lookup.  But it is still
  reasonable to assume that, with enough recorded gameplay data, you can model
  trends.  I started to do so by creating a visualization of the "next-state
  entropy" of expert players moving through [[https://www.johnsto.co.uk/design/making-dust2/][a popular Counter-Strike map]].  An
  initial choice is made (hot colors, bottom), invariably followed by fixed
  actions (cold colors), followed by another choice...

  #+attr_html: :width 50% :alt Heatmap showing entropy in different areas of a map
  [[file:img/entropy_visualization.png]]

  This high regularity meant that cluster analysis was effective in tightly
  grouping these openings.  These clusters formed the basis for the "opening
  book" I was after.  This ultimately gave me categorical data within which I
  was able to find trends.  It also helped me build regressors for predicting
  player movement and classifiers to distinguish human and machine play.

* Emacs Packages
  I'm a regular reviewer of new packages on [[https://melpa.org][MELPA]].  I also maintain a couple of
  my own that improve Emacs's REPLs (=shell-mode= but also
  =inferior-python-mode= and anything built on top of =comint=):
  - [[https://github.com/riscy/shx-for-emacs][shx-mode]] :: A set of "shell extras" that supports a simple markup language
       for embedding graphics and plots within a session (similar to a Jupyter
       notebook), adds event-driven and timed behaviors, and makes it easy for
       users to write their own shell commands in Emacs Lisp, and adds interface
       improvements such as improved syntax highlighting.  Available on [[https://stable.melpa.org/#/shx][MELPA]]
       since May 2017.
  - [[https://github.com/riscy/bifocal-mode][bifocal-mode]] :: A minor mode that splits the current window while you're
       scrolling the buffer.  A large window on top displays past output, while
       a smaller window on the bottom allows you to continue to interact with
       the current input and output.  Available on [[https://stable.melpa.org/#/bifocal][MELPA]] since June 2017.
* Other Projects
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: other_projects
  :END:
  Here are a few implementations and write-ups on some interesting algorithms:
  - [[https://github.com/riscy/machine_learning_linear_models][Machine Learning with Linear Models]] :: This is a small demo showcasing a few
       distinct "regressors" mapping vectors of observations /X/ to vectors of
       outcomes /Y/. Varying assumptions about the data can lead to different
       levels of performance - sometimes drastically.
  - [[https://github.com/riscy/sammon_mapping_gsl][Sammon Mapping]] :: Given a Euclidean distance matrix, there is a /closed
       form/ to resolve the corresponding points.  This computation is a key
       step in many embedding algorithms. But when you're given a distance
       matrix that is non-Euclidean, you might have to do something else.  The
       Sammon Map was an early attempt at this.  This is a C implementation
       using BLAS (requires the GNU scientific library) that also supports
       nonlinear dimensionality reduction.
  - [[https://github.com/riscy/a_star_on_grids][Best Practices for A\star on Grids]] :: I learned a bit about writing a good
       pathfinder in grad school.  Here's a list of ways to improve your A\star
       implementation, focusing on pathfinding on four- and eight-connected
       grids.  It's pitched at hobbyists and anyone looking for ways to make
       their existing code a bit faster, and has [[https://github.com/riscy/a_star_on_grids/tree/master/src][accompanying code in C++]].

  Beyond those listed above, I'm grateful to have been a part of a number of

  robotics, and real-time heuristic search:
