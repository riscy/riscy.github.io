Hi! I'm a <a href="https://riscy.io/#2020.08.11">computing scientist</a> interested in software quality and all sorts of
problems in optimization and search.  I completed my PhD in 2014 at the
<a href="https://cs.ualberta.ca">University of Alberta</a>, where I machine-learned pathfinding heuristics.  Since
then I worked with a great team on advancing the search engine at <a href="https://dissolve.com">Dissolve</a>, and
today I lead a team in Applied AI/ML at <a href="https://ibm.com">IBM</a> Enterprise Data&#x2026; (<a href="./portfolio.html">see portfolio</a>)

"There is a continuum of value in how pure a function is, and the value step
from almost-pure to completely-pure is smaller than that from spaghetti-state to
mostly-pure. Moving a function <i>towards</i> purity improves the code."

"The act of writing software is the act of naming, repeated over and over
again. It's likely that software engineers create more names than any other
profession. Given this, it's curious how little time is spent discussing names
in a typical computer science education." (<a href="https://leanpub.com/elementsofclojure">Elements of Clojure</a>)

"Implement new ideas in parallel with the old ones, rather than mutating the
existing code"; "If the task you are working on can be expressed as a pure
function that simply processes input parameters into a return structure, it is
easy to switch it out."  (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140719065227/http://www.altdev.co/2011/11/22/parallel-implementations/">Parallel Implementations</a>)

Bad <i>physical</i> design: "A few innocent #includes sometimes expand to megabytes
of header data once all the recursive inclusion is resolved"; "really easy to
screw up, but requires concentrated effort and hard work to fix."  Prevent with
<a href="https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~cappello/lectures/design-patterns/rc166-010d-ModularityPatterns_0.pdf">levelizing</a>, e.g. "header files (.h) cannot include other header files."

"Minimize control flow complexity and 'area under ifs', favoring consistent
execution paths and times over 'optimally' avoiding unnecessary work": "[this]
usually takes more absolute time, but it reduces the variability in frame times,
and eliminates a class of bugs."  (<a href="http://number-none.com/blow/john_carmack_on_inlined_code.html">Inlined Code</a>)

"When dealing with the wrong abstraction, the fastest way forward is back &#x2026;
re-introduce duplication by inlining the abstracted code back into every caller;
within each caller, use the parameters being passed to determine the subset of
the inlined code that this specific caller executes; delete the bits that aren't
needed for this particular caller." (<a href="https://www.sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction">The Wrong Abstraction</a>)

"A design principle devised by Bertrand Meyer &#x2026; every method should either be
a command that performs an action (changes state), or a query that returns
answer to the caller (without changing the state or causing side-effects), but
not both." (<a href="https://abdullin.com/command-query-separation/">Command-Query Separation</a>)

One level of indentation per method; don't use the ELSE keyword; wrap all
primitives and strings; first class collections; one dot per line; don't
abbreviate; keep all entities small; no classes with more than two instance
variables; no getters/setters/properties (<a href="https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/luontola/tdd-2009/ext/ObjectCalisthenics.pdf">Object Calisthenics</a>).

"Choose your return type based on what you need to continue fluent action
&#x2026; the problems of methods in a fluent interface is that they don't make much
sense on their own" (<a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FluentInterface.html">Fluent Interfaces</a>).  "Always return self"; "Remove any
getter methods [instead] create a command which will apply the data to the thing

"Create the object using a parameter-less constructor and then you set only
fields which you want using mutators &#x2026; [but then] fields cannot be declared
final".  Consider a Builder: "to make things more convenient, the builder
returns itself, so you can chain the method calls (fluent interface)"

"Work with percentiles rather than the mean (arithmetic average) of a set of
values.  Doing so makes it possible to consider the long tail of data points,
which often have significantly different (and more interesting) characteristics
than the average." (<a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920041528.do">Site Reliability Engineering</a>)
