"Resistance is a resource... it's information you didn't have.  You can push
back, or you can listen to it, and try to hear what it's really telling you.
And fix it."  For example, "if testing seems hard, there's something wrong with
your design." ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-2yFMzxqwU&t=1109][Resistance]])
