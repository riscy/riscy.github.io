"It can be tempting to add a new feature to a model that improves accuracy, even
when the accuracy gain is very small... Research solutions that provide a tiny
accuracy benefit at the cost of massive increases in system complexity are
rarely wise practice." ([[https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/43146.pdf][Epsilon Features]])
