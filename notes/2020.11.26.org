"When numbers of different magnitudes are [added/subtracted], digits of the
smaller-magnitude number are lost... when numbers very close to each other are
subtracted, the result's less significant digits consist mostly of rounding
errors."  ([[https://floating-point-gui.de/errors/propagation/][The Floating-Point Guide - Error Propagation]])
