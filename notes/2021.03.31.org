"Much of the logic in [an object-oriented] app exists in the messages, and the
messages don't actually happen until you reconstitute it all and put it in
memory [or] construct an imaginary mental model and supply the messages yourself
in order to understand what's going on." ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npOGOmkxuio][Rules]])
