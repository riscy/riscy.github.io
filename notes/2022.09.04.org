"A module that you have designed to be easy to change can be made difficult to
change by someone else who simply hangs a dependency on it... /I/ metrics
[instability scores ranging from 0â€“1] should /decrease/ in the direction of
dependency."  ([[https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-architecture-a/9780134494272/ch14.xhtml][Stable Dependencies Principle]])
