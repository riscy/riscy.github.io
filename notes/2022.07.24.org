"When we see advice telling us to do something small consistently, we usually
scoff.  After all, we are serious about what we do; we want to dedicate an hour,
not five minutes to it. And we will definitely never skip a day. That's until
you realize that it's not you talking, it's the highly motivated version of
you." ([[https://trms.me/the-value-of-doing-a-little/][The Value of Doing a Little]])
