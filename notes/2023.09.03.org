"A history in which every particular incident may be true, may on the whole be
false" -- "a little exaggeration, a little suppression, a judicious use of
epithets, a watchful and searching skepticism with respect to the evidence on
one side, a convenient credulity with respect to every report or tradition on
the other."  ([[http://www.blupete.com/Literature/Essays/Best/MacaulayModHistorian.htm][The Task of the Modern Historian]])
