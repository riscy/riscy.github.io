"'Writing' a sentence is an evolutionary process in which generations of
imperfectly adapted sentences arise, survive numerous trials, and settle into a
potential habitat, only to die off again and again, sometimes dooming the entire
ecosystem in the process, all in the service of formulating the fittest
expression." ([[https://hedgehogreview.com/web-features/thr/posts/field-notes-of-a-sentence-watcher][Field Notes of a Sentence Watcher]])
