A complicated system --- software or otherwise --- "not only makes our lives
difficult in the present, but it /accelerates the loss of knowledge over
time/... Each individual person knows a smaller percent... it's harder for them
to transmit their knowledge onto people in the future... and deep knowledge
becomes replaced by trivia." ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW-SOdj4Kkk][Preventing the Collapse of Civilization]])

Bonus: Abstraction saves effort at first, "somewhere through this chain it
becomes wrong. And that's how people are wrong a lot of the time... you start
out by being right and then you extrapolate it too far."
