"Inexperienced users of statistics tend to take for granted the link between
data and scientific issues and, as a result, may jump directly to a technique
based on data structure rather than scientific goal... the key to principled
statistical analysis is to bring analytic methods into close correspondence with
scientific questions." ([[https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004961][Ten Simple Rules for Effective Statistical Practice]])
