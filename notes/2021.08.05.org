"Two programs can compute the same function but may have different testabilities
[probability of failure given a fault]... a program with low testability is
unlikely to reveal faults through random black-box testing."  ([[https://www.unf.edu/~ncoulter/cen6070/handouts/minorreport/Voas.pdf][Predicting Where
Faults Can Hide from Testing]])
