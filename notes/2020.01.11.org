([[https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/site-reliability-engineering/9781491929117/ch09.html][Simplicity]]) but [[https://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/LispGoodNewsBadNews.pdf][Worse is Better]]: "It is more important for the implementation
to be simple than the interface... Completeness must be sacrificed whenever
implementation simplicity is jeopardized."
